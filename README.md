# xdifythis
This bot is very simple and created in a couple of weekends (spending just a couple of hours each weekend)

Developed in order to learn the Tweepy API and take advantage of it to laugh at stupid people on Twitter.

But don't worry, I'm not a bullie.

## How it works
It's very simple, ridiculous tweet you see, tweet you reply mentioning this bot (@xdifythis).
The bot will create a tweet on its TimeLine with the quoted tweet and a meme, tagging you.

### FAQ
Seriously is it needed? (FAQ)
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
#### Ooookay, some questions:

#### Can I download, modify and use the bot for my own?
Yes, BUT I will be grateful if you text/email me about it and cite me in your fork as the creator of this crap.

#### Seriously is it needed? (The bot)
NO, but I was bored and wanted to create a bot for Twitter.

#### Are you idiot?
YES

#### Do you code for a living? I hope not
YES

#### Are you kiddi...
No, I'm not.

I'm surprised just like you.

I don't know why, but someone find me "enough" smart to give me money for programming,
for whatever reason
