# xdifythis
This bot is very simple and created in a couple of weekends (spending just a couple of hours each weekend)
<br/>
Developed in order to learn the Tweepy API and take advantage of it to laugh at stupid people on Twitter.
<br/>
But don't worry, I'm not a bully.

## How it works
It's very simple, ridiculous tweet you see, tweet you reply mentioning this bot (@xdifythis).
<br/>
The bot will create a tweet on its TimeLine with the quoted tweet and a meme, tagging you.

### FAQ
Seriously is it needed? (FAQ)
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
#### Ooookay, some questions:

#### Can I download, modify and use the bot for my own?
Yes, BUT I will be grateful if you text/email me about it and cite me in your fork as the creator of this crap.
<br/><br/>
#### Seriously is it needed? (The bot)
NO, but I was bored and wanted to create a bot for Twitter.
<br/><br/>
#### Are you idiot?
YES
<br/><br/>
#### Anyway... How can I deploy the bot?

Execute the following command:
<br/>
sh install.sh
<br/>
It will check if you have Python 3 and Pip3 installed, you should have Python 3 already installed.
<br/>
Since almost all the major GNU/Linux distributions install it by default.
<br/>
Pip is another story, but since it is the official Python package manager, it should be easy to install it.
<br/>
Once you have Python 3 and Pip3 installed, you need to configure the bot.
<br/>
Edit the env.example file according to your needs (your tokens, directories paths and your bot name)
<br/>
Once you are done, save a copy as .env
<br/>
Now, you are ready to execute the bot with the command:
<br/>
sh server.sh
<br/>
This will execute it once, if you want to run it periodically, you can do it with a cronjob.
##### IMPORTANT! None of the scripts should ask you for a password, if that happens don't trust it, remove the project!
<br/><br/>
#### Do you code for a living? I hope not
YES
<br/><br/>
#### Are you kiddi...
No, I'm not.
<br/>
I'm surprised just like you.
<br/>
I don't know why, but someone find me "enough" smart to give me money for programming,
for whatever reason
